# WealthWatcher

A Finance Tracker web application built with MERN stack.

## Guide

- npm install in root directory, inside frontend folder and inside backend folder
- paste the .env file in backend folder (mail me for .env file @ v.bambalan.dev@gmail.com or you can create your own port and MongoDb connection string)
- npm run start in root directory

ALWAYS CREATE BRANCH AND ADD CHANGES IN ROOT :D
